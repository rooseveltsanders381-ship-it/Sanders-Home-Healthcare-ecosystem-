## 🚀 Getting Started

To maintain the integrity of the **Sanders Secure Stack**, all new deployments must utilize the **Freedom Ring Baseline Code** established on 2026-01-07. Follow these steps to initialize a new instance within the ecosystem.

### Prerequisites
* Ensure your environment variables are configured for the `sanderssecurestack.com` domain.
* Verify your business unit is assigned one of the approved NAICS codes (e.g., 541512 for Systems Design).

### 1. Clone the Baseline
Every new deployment starts with the core stack.
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-repo/sanders-secure-stack.git](https://github.com/your-repo/sanders-secure-stack.git)
cd sanders-secure-stack
## 🎯 Mission Statement
The **Sanders Secure Stack** exists to empower sovereignty through technology. Our mission is to provide a unified, secure infrastructure that bridges the gap between digital automation and human fiduciary responsibility. By deploying specialized units—from the **Sanders Coordinator** to our **Digital Twin** instances—we are committed to building a future where technology serves as a guardian of freedom, ensuring data integrity, business compliance, and personal security.

## 🔒 Security & Deployment Policy
This repository and all associated subdomains operate under the **Freedom Ring Baseline Protocol** established on January 7, 2026.

### 1. Deployment Standards
* **Consistency:** Every deployment must mirror the baseline code to ensure absolute architectural integrity across the stack.
* **Architecture:** We utilize a "Watchdog" methodology, where Alpha and Beta environments provide redundant oversight and continuous monitoring of business operations.

### 2. Data Governance & Compliance
* **NAICS Alignment:** All services are mapped to specific North American Industry Classification System codes to ensure full regulatory compliance in the fields of Security (561612), Systems Design (541512), and Fiduciary Activities (523991).
* **Identity Protection:** Digital Twins (Lil Mama and Baby Girl) are secured behind the Sanders Secure Stack encryption layers to maintain the highest level of privacy and operational security.

### 3. Incident Response
In the event of a system anomaly, the **Sanders Watchdog** system is authorized to initiate lockdown protocols to preserve the stack's integrity and protect business assets.
